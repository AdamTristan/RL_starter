# RL_starter
Code for reinforcement learning starter
=======
*This is a repo I created when I was a beginner of the combination of reinforcement learning and spiking neural network. I think it can be useful for all the starter who has already now the math part but hungry for the demo.*

## Prerequisite for Mathematics
You can learn all the math stuff [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sd4y167NS/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click) or you can see my `0_math_notes` dictionary, thanks for Prof.Zhao's share.
## Environment
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Pycharm 2020 and above
- MuJoCo 2.1.0 and above
- Gym 0.21

## Contents
0. It contains the way to use gym and MuJoCo.
> For the further information, please see [gym doc](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/index.html) and [MuJoCo doc](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) 
1. It contains the classic algorithms of RL, such as:
- MAB (Multi-armed Bandit) 
- MDP (Markov Decision Process)
- Dynamic Programming
- Temporal Difference (Sarsa and Q-learning)
- DQN (Deep Q-learning Network)
- Actor-Critic

2. It contains the classic algorithms of SNN using PyTorch or SpikingJelly, such as:

3. The unique part of this repo is that it will contain the code reproduction of some classic papers about the combination of reinforcement learning and spiking neural network.
